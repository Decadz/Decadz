## Hi, I'm Christian! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior applied scientist at Oracle, where I work on applying large language models to challenging problems in healthcare. Previously, I worked at Amazon, developing a foundation model for 3D computer vision. I completed my PhD at [Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/cdsai) (VUW) in New Zealand, where my research focused on meta-learning loss functions for deep neural networks. My current research interests include meta-learning, meta-optimization, hyperparameter optimization, few-shot learning, and continual learning. For students with prior publication experience in meta-learning or related areas, I am open to co-supervision of masters and PhD projects through VUW with Dr Qi Chen and Prof Bing Xue. If you are interested please do not hesitate to contact me.
