## Hi, I'm Christian! ðŸ‘‹

I am an applied scientist at Amazon, working on building foundation models for 3D computer vision. I was previously a PhD student
at [Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/cdsai) (VUW), working on meta-learning in deep neural networks. My research interests are in topics related to optimization-based meta-learning, with a specific focus on meta-learned loss functions and optimizers. For students with prior publication experience in meta-learning or related areas, I am open to co-supervision of masters and PhD projects through VUW with Dr Qi Chen and Prof Bing Xue. If you are interested please do not hesitate to contact me.
