## Hi, I'm Christian! ðŸ‘‹

I am a research fellow at [Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/cdsai) (VUW), working on meta-learning in deep neural networks. My current application areas are in topics related to optimization-based few-shot learning, with a specific focus on meta-learned loss functions and optimizers. For students with prior publication experience in meta-learning or related areas, I am open to co-supervision of PhD projects through VUW with Dr Qi Chen, and Prof Bing Xue. If you are interested please do not hesitate to contact me.
